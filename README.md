    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated IT student at PLP (Power Learn Project Africa), I am eager to apply my technical skills 
      and hands-on project experience in a dynamic, collaborative environment. In addition to my studies, I 
      am actively expanding my expertise through online courses in database management, software 
      engineering, Python, web development, and business startup fundamentals. Beyond technology, I 
      have a strong passion for content creation and video editing, particularly for social media platforms. 
      Managing and growing digital communities excites me, and I enjoy crafting engaging visual stories 
      that resonate with audiences. Committed to continuous learning and professional growth, I strive to 
      merge my technical expertise with creative digital strategies to make a meaningful impact.
